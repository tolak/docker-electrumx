> Run an Electrum server with one command(BTG dev used only)

An easily configurable Docker image for running an Electrum server.

## Usage

```
docker run \
  -v /home/username/electrumx:/data \
  -e DAEMON_URL=http://user:pass@host:port \
  -e COIN=BitcoinSegwit \
  -p 50002:50002 \
  lukechilds/electrumx
```

If you are connecting electrumx to a test net of Bitcoin GOld, remember to set env ```COIN=BitcoinGold``` and ```NET=testnet```

If your Daemon is runing on your localhost machine, you can pass ```-network host``` and set host ip with 127.0.0.1 like ```http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:18332``` to let Docker communicate with host service.

If there's an SSL certificate/key (`electrumx.crt`/`electrumx.key`) in the `/data` volume it'll be used. If not, one will be generated for you.

You can view all ElectrumX environment variables here: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/blob/master/docs/environment.rst

### TCP Port

By default only the SSL port is exposed. You can expose the unencrypted TCP port with `-p 50001:50001`, although this is strongly discouraged.

### WebSocket Port

You can expose the WebSocket port with `-p 50004:50004`.

### RPC Port

To access RPC from your host machine, you'll also need to expose port 8000. You probably only want this available to localhost: `-p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000`.

If you're only accessing RPC from within the container, there's no need to expose the RPC port.

### Version

You can also run a specific version of ElectrumX if you want.

```
docker run \
  -v /home/username/electrumx:/data \
  -e DAEMON_URL=http://user:pass@host:port \
  -e COIN=BitcoinSegwit \
  -p 50002:50002 \
  lukechilds/electrumx:v1.8.7
```
